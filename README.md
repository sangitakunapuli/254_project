# README

This repository contains the code from our project (F24, CS254). This repository has all of the code we worked on, but not all of it is up-to-date and working. See the final folder for the code and test files we used in our results.

In order to run the code, you must have the necessary tools installed. We used:
* Yosys (https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
* Z3 (https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/)
* RISCV-Formal (https://github.com/YosysHQ/riscv-formal, https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/sby/en/latest/install.html)
